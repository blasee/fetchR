# fetchR 2.1-2

## Bug fixes

* Fix future warnings from CRAN checks on R-devel (#10)

# fetchR 2.1-1

## Minor changes

* You can now specify up to 1 direction per degree on the compass rose 
(`n_directions = 90`).

# fetchR 2.1-0

## Minor changes

* Site names are automatically read from the data associated with the shapefile.
  The names have to be in a column with a name matching the regular expression;
  `^[Nn]ames{0,1}$`.
  
* Check out the 
  [online web application](http://windfetch.cer.auckland.ac.nz/) for **fetchR**.

* Use `on.exit` to close the KML file connection in `kml,Fetch` method.

# fetchR 2.0-0

## Major changes

* **fetchR** is now generalised to incorporate `SpatialPolyons` representing any
marine location on Earth (#6). As a result, **fetchR** 2.0 is no longer limited 
to calculating wind fetch within New Zealand coastal areas.

### Rewrite the entire algorithm for calculating wind fetch. 

* The `rgeos::gBuffer` function is used to calculate the end points of the fetch 
vectors at their maximum distance.

* The interactions between the fetch vectors and the coastlines, or any of the 
polygons, are calculated with the `rgeos::gIntersection` function as opposed to
the slow, iterative algorithm used by the package's predecessors.

* Computation times have dramatically decreased.

## Minor changes

* Create a vignette for the package; `vignette("introduction-to-fetchR")`.
