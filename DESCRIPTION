Description: Wind fetch is the unobstructed length of water over which wind can
    blow from a certain direction. The wind fetch is typically calculated for many directions
    around the compass rose for a given location, which can then be incorporated 
    into a larger model (such as the InVEST coastal vulnerability model;
    <http://data.naturalcapitalproject.org/invest-releases/documentation/2_2_0/coastal_vulnerability.html>),
    or simply averaged for a reasonable measure of 
    the overall wind exposure for a specific marine location. The process of calculating
    wind fetch can be extremely time-consuming and tedious, particularly if a large
    number of fetch vectors are required at many locations. The 'fetchR' package
    calculates wind fetch and summarises the information efficiently. There are 
    also plot methods to help visualise the wind exposure at the various
    locations, and methods to output the fetch vectors to a KML file for further
    investigation.
